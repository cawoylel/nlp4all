        "Few months ago, we released __windanam__, a collection of multidialectal speech recognition models for the Fula language, which is underrepresented in NLP solutions. During the development phase, we encountered significant hurdles in gathering data and creating the models. The task of developing Speech Recognition Systems for such languages presents unique challenges. The process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which relies on a supervised learning approach, necessitates the availability of annotated datasets. These datasets must include both the audio recordings and their corresponding textual transcriptions. However, acquiring this type of data is particularly arduous for languages that are predominantly spoken and either lack a written form or have an unstandardized script.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this guide, we outline the foundational steps necessary for developing an ASR model for languages that do not have pre-existing annotated datasets for ASR. We detail the strategies and methodologies that contributed to the successful creation of __windanam__, covering everything from the initial data collection phase to the model training stage. This guide marks the beginning of our [_NLP4ALL_](https://github.com/cawoylel/nlp4all) series, which is focused on simplifying the process of building NLP models for underrepresented languages and making it more accessible. Our initiative is not limited to just one language; it embodies a broader mission to promote open-source collaboration and democratize NLP technology for every language. We aim to provide a replicable framework that communities can adapt for their languages, aligning with our vision of making NLP technology widely accessible.\n",
        "\n",
        "While this tutorial uses the Seereer language as a case study, the outlined process is applicable to any language facing similar challenges of underrepresentation in the NLP domain. Notably, there is a lack of annotated datasets for the development of ASR models in Seereer. By selecting Seereer as our example, we dissect the entire workflow, from the generation of data to the training of the model. This includes steps such as audio-speech scraping, short segments alignment, data pocessing, and the culmination of building your ASR model through the fine-tuning of an existing open-source model."

        "To train a Speech Recognition model, you need a pair of spoken utterances and the corresponding textual transcription. How do you find this data? One good resource is the Common Voice project, a data collection initiative where speakers record themselves reading sentences. To date, it includes over a hundred languages, and the language you're interested in may be among them. Unfortunately, Sereer is not included.\n",
        "\n",
        "If your language doesn't have annotated data for ASR, maybe you can find some audiobooks with their transcriptions. One audiobook resource that covers many languages is the Bible. This book has been translated into more than 4,000 languages in audiobook form. These recordings are made by native speakers, offering authentic insights into pronunciation, intonation, and linguistic nuances. However, we only have transcriptions for 1,000 languages. This is really a valuable resource for many languages, and perhaps the language you are interested in is included. You can check for this on the following website: https://www.bible.com/. Fortunately, the Seereer language has audiobooks and the corresponding transcriptions, for example, for the book of Samuel: https://www.bible.com/bible/3751/1SA.1.SRR23.\n",

While this ensures high-quality audio, models trained on these data might struggle in noisier, real-world conditions where speech patterns are more varied and spontaneous. Additionally, the majority of these recordings are by adult males, which could limit the model's ability to accurately recognize voices of other genders. The Seereer Bible recordings might not be perfect, but for a language with limited online resources, they provide a starting point for building powerful ASR tools."

For the speech processor, it depends on the model. In the case of Whisper, the speech encoder takes as input a Spectogram (an image representation of the audio). So the audio processor will transform the raw speech audio into spectogram. This operation is called `FeatureExtraction` here.

Acknowledging these limitations, we can for instance employ **data augmentation** techniques to enhance the robustness of our models. By introducing elements like background noise into the dataset, we can simulate more diverse listening environments, thereby preparing our models to perform reliably in a variety of real-world scenarios."
