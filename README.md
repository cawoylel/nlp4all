While at [Cawoylel](https://cawoylel.com/) our primary focus is the Fula language, in this **NLP4ALL** repository, we openly share our journey and the methodologies behind building these technologies. We provide **step-by-step guides**, **tutorials**, and **code snippets**, allowing others to replicate our efforts with the Fula language or adapt our work. Our goal is to offer **readily usable templates** that other communities can leverage to develop similar technologies for their languages.
