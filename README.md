## About This Repository

While our primary focus is the Fula language, in this repository, we openly share our journey and the methodologies behind building these technologies. We provide step-by-step guides, tutorials, and code snippets, allowing others to replicate our efforts with the Fula language or adapt our work to their linguistic endeavors. Our goal is to offer readily usable templates that other communities can leverage to develop similar technologies for their languages. We firmly believe that sharing knowledge is pivotal to collective progress and is crucial for enabling African languages to flourish in the digital age.
